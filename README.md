# Scaffold for The Composable Architecture 

## Implementation (cut to the chase)

* [Python3](Python) (MVP working: multiple Reducer + View stub generation)

## Motivation

For those doing iOS dev, [The Composable Architecture](https://github.com/pointfreeco/swift-composable-architecture) by [PointFree](https://github.com/pointfreeco) is an excellent thing.

`tca-scaffold` is tool for quickly generating stubs of TCA features. It generates basic `Reducer` and `View` files for each feature name.

## Possible enhancements

* setup of higher order reducer with sub-reducers
* creation of navigation stacks with sub-features (perhaps using decoupled navigation)
* stub out unit test using e.g. `TestStore`

## Let's go

Visit the [Python3](Python) page for info on installing and using `tca-scaffold`.
